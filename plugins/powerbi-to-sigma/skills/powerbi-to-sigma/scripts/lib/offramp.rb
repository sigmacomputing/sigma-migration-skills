# offramp.rb — record every point where a run LEAVES the golden path.
#
# The hard part of debugging inconsistent agent runs is not "did it fail" but
# "WHERE did it leave the rails" — which gate was waived, which stop was hit,
# which degraded mode was taken. Those off-ramps were previously scattered across
# prose warnings and a couple of ad-hoc files. This appends a structured line to
# <WORK>/offramps.jsonl at each one, so a single file answers "where did this run
# defect?" post-hoc (and verify-complete.rb surfaces the trail).
#
# Kinds (stable strings — group on these in telemetry):
#   cred-gate-waived     SIGMA_SKIP_CRED_GATE used — creds unresolved, run may die at first API call
#   doctor-gate-waived   --skip-doctor-gate / SIGMA_SKIP_DOCTOR_GATE used
#   pass1-stop           PASS 1 ended at exit 12 (parity + gates NOT run yet)
#   converter-stop       converter unavailable / refused — routed to a fallback
#   workbook-handoff     workbook build raised (exit 4) — untranslatable fields handed off
#   degraded-fastpath    --yes fast path proceeded with missing discovery artifacts
#   gate-waived          an assert-phase6-ran gate waived (mirrored from waivers.json)
#   stale-skill-waived   SIGMA_ALLOW_STALE used — run proceeded on a stale checkout
#   loop-stop            the loop breaker tripped (verbatim signature repeat, same
#                        failure MODE with no measured progress, or the attempt
#                        cap) — hard STOP
#   mission-scope        mission.json stated scope applied (E9.6 — informational)

#                        worksheets was ledgered instead of stopped for (E9.6/A2)
#   png-read-stale       a png-read.json predating this run's discovery fetch was
#                        set aside (no stale-seed reuse — wave-1 #2a)

  # SINCE THE LAST GREEN RESET. Three stop rules, each covering the others'
  # blind spot (PR-507 finding 1A redesign):
  #
  #   :stop  S1 verbatim repeat — this exact signature already occurred.
  #          Identical failures and pure reorders (error_digest sorts the
  #          detail tail) stop at attempt 2, as before.
  #   :stop  S2 no progress — `mode:` (the failure-MODE key: same failure KIND
  #          with counts masked; build with failure_mode) already occurred and
  #          `measure:` (the surviving failure count; region_measure) is NOT a
  #          strict improvement on the BEST (lowest) measure yet seen for that
  #          mode. A converging repair loop (5→3→2→1 unresolved refs) improves
  #          every attempt and never stops; growing, oscillating, churning, and
  #          unmeasurable same-mode failures stop at attempt 2. Comparing to
  #          the best-yet (not the previous) measure keeps an oscillator from
  #          "improving" on alternate attempts forever.
  #   :cap   S3 attempt cap — `scope:` (a per-(script,context) bucket) has now
  #          burned ATTEMPT_CAP attempts without a green reset, regardless of
  #          signatures. No signature scheme can bound a loop that mints fresh
  #          failure text every attempt; the cap is the unconditional
  #          termination guarantee (it also bounds glacial-but-real 550→549→…
  #          convergence — deliberate: the handoff prescribes incremental
  #          repair, and ATTEMPT_CAP unattended attempts is already generous).
  #
  # The record a stop lands on is stamped {'stop': true, 'stop_rule': ...}:
  # S2/S3 can trip WITHOUT any signature reaching a 2-count, so
  # verify-complete.rb refuses completion (exit 5) over a stop-stamped trail
  # as well as over any 2-count signature — same post-reset window.
  #
  # Callers that pass only `signature:` get S1 + S3 (cap scope defaults to the
  # signature's script:context prefix) — byte-compatible with the old
  # stop-at-2 contract. Pre-upgrade records (no mode/scope keys) never pair
  # with new ones and are NOT counted toward the cap, so an upgrade restarts
  # counting instead of springing an instant stop on a long-lived workdir
  # (same accepted trade as the finalize cleanup-key addition).
  #
  # Counts are NOT cumulative over the workdir's whole lifetime: a GREEN
  # finalize appends a {'reset': true} record (loop_reset below) and counting
  # restarts after it — a green run has just DISPROVEN that the earlier
  # failures were a grind loop, so a stale 1-count from days ago must not
  # convert the next unrelated same-signature failure into a false hard-STOP.
  # The reset is append-only (never truncates the log), so the full history
  # stays auditable and the planned E5.19 reset defense can tell this
  # sanctioned post-green record from an operator clearing the file to dodge
  # the breaker (which remains operator-only). Never fatal.
