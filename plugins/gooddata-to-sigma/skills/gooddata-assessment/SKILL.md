  Take inventory of a GoodData Cloud / GoodData.CN estate and produce a
  migration-readiness readout — workspace, dataset, metric, insight, and
  dashboard counts; a MAQL-complexity histogram (which metrics use BY / WITHIN /
  BY ALL / FOR time transforms); an insight visualization-type mix; and per-
  dashboard AUTO / HINT / MANUAL / UNHANDLED tags scored against the
  gooddata-to-sigma converter's actual coverage. Use when a user wants to scope
  a GoodData→Sigma migration, audit estate sprawl, or pick which dashboards to
  convert first. Read-only, all-free pre-scoping over the declarative workspace
  export. Also assesses the legacy GoodData Platform (classic /gdc, SST/TT auth)
  and sweeps EVERY project a user can access under one domain in a single run.

# GoodData assessment

Read-only migration-readiness readout for a GoodData Cloud / .CN estate. Pulls
the declarative layout (no writes) and scores it against what
`gooddata-to-sigma` can actually convert.

> Status: working + live-validated. `scripts/assess.py` reuses the converter's
> own MAQL translator for honest coverage scoring (no guessing) and tags each
> dashboard AUTO / HINT / MANUAL / UNHANDLED.

## What it reports

- **Inventory** — workspaces, datasets, metrics, insights, dashboards.
- **MAQL complexity** — histogram of metrics by construct (plain agg / `WHERE` /
  `BY`-`WITHIN`-`BY ALL` context / `FOR` time transforms / ranking), since
  context + time intel are the conversion-risk drivers (`maql-mapping.md`).
- **Visualization mix** — insight `visualizationUrl` histogram, with each type
  tagged against `viz-type-mapping.md` (auto-mappable vs flagged).
- **Per-dashboard tag** — AUTO (fully mappable), HINT (minor manual), MANUAL
  (context MAQL / RLS review), UNHANDLED (exotic widgets / compute-only metrics).
- **Shortlist** — value/cost-ranked migration order.

## Usage

**GoodData Cloud / .CN** (Bearer API token, `/api/v1`):

```bash
eval "$(../gooddata-to-sigma/scripts/get-token.sh)"
python3 scripts/assess.py --workspace <id>     # or --all (all workspaces in ONE org)
```

**Legacy GoodData Platform** (classic `/gdc`, SST/TT auth) — different product,
detected by a `help.gooddata.com/doc/enterprise` / `/gdc/...` footprint rather
than `<org>.cloud.gooddata.com`:

```bash
export GOODDATA_PLATFORM_HOST=https://acme.on.gooddata.com
export GOODDATA_PLATFORM_USER=...  GOODDATA_PLATFORM_PASSWORD=...
python3 scripts/assess_platform.py --all       # EVERY project the user can access — one identity, one sweep
python3 scripts/assess_platform.py --project <pid>
```

> **Multi-"instance" note.** On the Platform, "separate instances" are **projects
> under one domain**, so `--all` sweeps them all from a single login — this is the
> answer to "can one API pull across instances?" On **Cloud**, each org is a
> separate host+token; there you re-point `GOODDATA_HOST`/`GOODDATA_TOKEN` and
> re-run `assess.py --all` per org, then merge. Platform scoring reuses the same
> MAQL translator as Cloud (classic refs are normalized first). See
> `../gooddata-to-sigma/refs/gooddata-platform-api.md`.

Usage telemetry (per-dashboard view counts) is the universal weak spot — it is
not in the declarative model; note it as a manual input if needed.
