# Pure logic for the domo DM column pre-flight check (bead m655): diffing a
# Domo dataset's schema columns against a warehouse table's REAL columns
# against what discovery/dataset-map.json's excludeColumns/columnOverrides
# already resolve, and — for anything still unresolved — checking one
# extensible derivation-pattern registry for an auto-*suggestion* (never an
# auto-applied fix; see docs/superpowers/specs/2026-07-31-domo-dm-column-
# preflight-design.md). No HTTP, no filesystem — the live warehouse-column
# fetch is scripts/preflight-columns.rb's sole network seam; everything here
# is pure and offline-testable (test/test-column-preflight.rb), matching
# build-dm.rb's own derive_map_entry/autofill_dataset_map split.

  # A dataset-map.json entry flagged with one of these `_source` values (see
  # build-dm.rb's derive_map_entry) has no real warehouse table to check yet —
  # a query-only stream, or landed data with no connector at all. Shared here
  # (not just preflight-columns.rb's own concern) so build-dm.rb's "needs
  # human review" warning and preflight-columns.rb's/run_preflight's skip
  # condition can never drift apart into two different lists.
